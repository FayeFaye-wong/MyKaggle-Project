**Predict Future Sales-Feature Engineering and EDA**

[Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wongfeiyeung/predict-future-sales-feature-engineering-and-eda)

This project needs to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month using a time-series dataset of daily sales data. This EDA includes data preprocessing and meaningful visualizations and involves creating lag features that compare current and past observations. 

In time series data, there is often a dependency between observations and their previous values. This temporal dependency can be incorporated into the model by performing lag operations. For example, in stock price prediction, the prices of the past few days can provide information about future price trends. In time series data analysis, lag operations are also useful for data alignment and comparison, ensuring that observations from different time points align simultaneously. This is valuable for calculating differences, correlations, and other statistical metrics between observations.

**Spaceship-Titanic-Feature-Engineering-EDA**

This EDA project aims to explore which variable is the most important factor affecting whether a passenger will be sent to another dimension and investigate how each variable is related.
